Description:
    Checks the number of occurances of subsequences of lengths from 1 to L.
    Divides the number of occurances by the sequence's length in order to
    obtain relative frequencies. Creates a dictionary for subsequences of
    each length. When checking for subsequences of length 1, the method
    records each individual symbol that appears and stores it as the
