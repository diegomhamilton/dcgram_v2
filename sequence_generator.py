'''
Name: generate_sequence
Input:
    *machine: DMarkov machine from which the sequence will be created.
    *D: memory of the machine.
    *L: sequence size.
Output:
    *sequence: sequence with size L obtained from machine with memory D.
Description:
    Starts with an predetermined state (all zeroes) and iterates L times,
    choosing next state in accord with labels probabilities.
